# algorithm-for-the-Floyd-s-shortest-path-problem

 a programin VS C++ 2017to implement the algorithm for the Floyd's shortest path problem shown in class. Yourprogram should read in an input file containingweights for the adjacency matrix ofa weighted digraph. The input file should be named p4data.txtand hard coded in your program. Your program then computes the D matrix and the P matrix for the digraph and displays them to the screen (ina 2-dimensional fashion). The last thing your program does before it quits is to prompt the user fortwo vertices (say, i and j) and compute and display the shortest path from vertex ito vertex j. The following shows a scenario of running a sample program, where user's inputs are represented inboldface. We assume the input file contains information shown as follows.
